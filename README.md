## Introduction

PyCli-GPT is a Python CLI works like [Chat-GPT](https://chat.openai.com) and is an application that provides helpful information, answer questions, and assist users with various tasks using the power of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. Whether you need information, creative ideas, or assistance with specific tasks, PyCli-GPT is here to help, all within the familiar confines of your terminal.

#### About

It serves as a showcase of various software engineering and Python programming concepts, including the separation of concerns, Object Relational Mappers, entity relationships, database evolution with migrations, database population using seed data, and database constraints using SQLAlchemy and Alembic. This project was also geared toward showcasing fun PyPi packages like:
