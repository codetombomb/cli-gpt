## Introduction

PyCli-GPT is a Python CLI application designed to provide helpful information, answer questions, and assist users with various tasks using the power of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. Whether you need information, creative ideas, or assistance with specific tasks, PyCli-GPT is here to help, all within the familiar confines of your terminal.

#### Inspiration
PyCli-GPT was created as a demonstration project for Software Engineering students at Flatiron School. It serves as a showcase of various software engineering and Python programming concepts, including the separation of concerns, Object Relational Mappers, entity relationships, database evolution with migrations, database population using seed data, and database constraints using SQLAlchemy and Alembic. This project was also geared toward showcasing fun PyPi packages like: 

- [prettycli](https://github.com/noyoshi/prettycli#-prettycli-)
- [simple-term-menu](https://github.com/IngoMeyer441/simple-term-menu#simple-terminal-menu)
- [python-decouple](https://github.com/HBNetwork/python-decouple#id17)
- [faker (python)](https://github.com/joke2k/faker)
- [progress](https://github.com/verigak/progress/#easy-progress-reporting-for-python)
- [openai](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference). 

#### Who Can Benefit
PyCli-GPT is designed with Python programming learners and software engineering enthusiasts in mind. If you're on a journey to master Python or software engineering in general, this tool can be a valuable addition to your learning resources. Just dig through the code and reach out with any questions! 

#### How It Works
This CLI application interacts with the OpenAI API, offering an experience similar to chatting with GPT. Users can sign up for an account, ask questions or provide prompts, receive AI-generated feedback from the OpenAI API, retrieve previous chat sessions tied to their accounts, and log out, all from the comfort of their terminal.

#### Future Plans
As of now, PyCli-GPT's primary goal is to inspire and educate. There are no specific future plans for the project other than sparking an interest in coding conversations among those who are curious about the world of software engineering and AI.

## Getting Started

***This project is meant for you to run locally on your own computer*** 

To use this application, you will need to obtain a ***paid*** API key from OpenAI.
